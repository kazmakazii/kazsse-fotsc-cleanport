    "description": "Dwarven Spiders are small, agile constructs that scuttle through the narrow passages of Dwemer ruins.\n\nServing as maintenance and security units, these spider-like machines can deliver electric shocks to their foes and are often found in swarms, overwhelming trespassers with sheer numbers.\n\nTheir bodies house various mechanical components, which are highly sought after by scholars and adventurers alike for study and trade."
